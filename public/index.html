      <h1>DeBray Carpenter - Sofware Development Extraordinaire<h1>
        <p>I am a software developer with over 3 years of experience using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. When I first started coding, I did so because I had a vision for an entertainment site that I wanted to create and the resolve to learn the necessary skills to bring that idea into fruition. Over the past few months, I have been tightening up my javascript skills as an Apprentice Software Developer and working in team to complete various one-week sprints. I've also used the space as a place to get comfortable speaking in front of crowds and helping people to troubleshoot and solve problems. I, following the lead of one of my colleagues, started holding weekly brownbag sessions touching on various topics within software development/engineering. One of those presentations was on Nodes and Linked Lists, which is one of the simpler data structures, which forms the foundation necessary to understand more complicated data structures. I plan to present a simple Ember.js build next week and hopefully create simple Android and iOS apps using Deco IDE, a React-native framework (which was recently acquired by AirBNB). Over the next few months, I plan to learn, build and teach until I reach my wit's end (if that exists). I never quit and when presented with dificult problems, I am motivated and anxious to solve them, it is actually when I am at my best. I feel that I would make a good addition to any company or team where I would be challenged and allowed to make an impact as I have good leadership qualities and the ability plan for edge-cases (in and out of code).
