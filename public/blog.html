      <h1>Major Keys for Tech Entrepreneurs From the Forward JS 6 Conference</h1>
      <p>There was a lot of information shared at the Forward JS 6 Conference in San Francisco. There were many great speakers with years of JS knowledge and experience sharing information useful even to JS adepts. The key takeaway from this conference is that in order to be a great software developer, you have to be open to receiving new information, and consequently changing formats and techniques in order to make your work more efficient and user friendly. The best software developers are constantly learning.
<br></br>
<b>"True knowledge exists in knowing that you know nothing. And in knowing that you know nothing, that makes you the smartest of all..." -Socrates</b>
<br></br>
Much of the information presented was pertinent primarily for software developers at bigger companies, but much of the information presented at the "Hacking Web Performance" as well the "Writing Reasonable Javascript" lecture can prove very useful for the aspiring tech entrepreneur (and anyone with a website for that matter).

<b>Hacking the First Load</b>
<br>
Any web developer or tech entrepreneur who has heard the saying, "your first impression is your only impression," knows the significance of optimizing the performance (or perceived performance) of the first load. There are many variables that affect the load time of a site's landing page, but the first order of business to improve performance is to reduce the amount of redirects (or avoid them altogether) as well as reducing the number of roundtrips by keeping ATF (above-the-fold) content below 14kb, allowing the browser to generate view in a single roundtrip, rather than 20kb, which would require the client to acknowledge the first 14kb before receiving and displaying the remaining content (causing the load-time to increase).
<br></br>
<b>Hacking Web Performance</b>
<br>
Bounce rate, one of the stats that you want to keep down on your website, is highly influenced by the performance/speed (or perceived performance) of a site. A high bounce rate usually translates to a low-turnover and conversion rate. The underestimation of the importance of mobile site optimization is a major factor in terms of site performance. Studies show that between 2013 and 2014, the number of people browsing the internet via their mobile devices surpassed the number of desktop users and this trend will likely continue. Yet another factor in mobile optimization is testing for Facebook browser functionality which accounts for over 50% of mobile site visits.
<br></br>
<b>Hacking Images</b>
<br>
In order to be a good software developer, you must constantly be learning and adapting to new technology and adopting practices that increase performance and productivity. Reformatting images and making low-res versions of images for clients with slower internet connections is a good way to ensure that site performance does not suffer when connection speeds are low. A good way to increase (perceived) performance is to use progressive JPEGs, which load a low-res version of the image initially and load the full resolution content when in view on the browser. It is also recommended to use animated PNGs rather than animated GIFs and/or animated WebPs due to lower file sizes, and consequently faster load times.
<br></br>
If all of these variables are taken into consideration, depending on the complexity of your site, you can significantly improve the speed and performance of your site. Increased speed and performance has been proven to lower the user bounce rate and to increase turnover and sales as well as advertising/affiliate marketing profits.</p>
